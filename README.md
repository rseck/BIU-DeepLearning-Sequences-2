# BIU-DeepLearning-Sequences-2
Task No. 2 in deep learning for sequences course by Yoav Goldberg. semester b year 23-24

all executions run ner and pos learning process. 
the code also evaluates dev set accuracy in every epoch and prints test evaluation every epoch.

part 1
to run tagger1, simply run 'python tagger1.py part_1'

part 3
to run tagger2, simply run 'python tagger1.py part_3'

part 4
to run tagger3 with pre-trained embeddings, simply run python tagger3.py with_pre_trained_vecs
to run tagger3 without pre-trained embeddings, simply run python tagger3.py without_pre_trained_vecs
